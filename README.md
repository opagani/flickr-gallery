flickr-gallery
================

This is a sample app that shows a Flickr Gallery with photos from Uruguay and Argentina.

Take the http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html API method and create a page that requests the photo data (using JS) for a set and displays the photos in a Flickr Light Box-like manner, with the photo, title and photo owner. Next / Previous buttons would navigate you through the set.

Installation
------------

```bash
$ npm install -g bower
$ cd flickr-gallery
$ bower install
```
